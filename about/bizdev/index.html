                        <p class = "box-description">The Internal Development Team works on making sure everything runs smoothly within STEMchats. <b>As a nonprofit organization that aims to have a large impact on the STEM field, we have to make sure all the teams work efficiently while maintaining a strong team culture.</b></p>
                        <p class = "box-description">This is  achieved through identifying Key Performance Metrics (KPIs) and then working around these to submit internal audit reports, which include recommendations for the numerous teams.</p>
                        <p class = "box-description">Other projects include team socials, assisting the Leadership Team with onboarding and recruitment, member evaluations, and undertaking various new initiatives, such as the Internal Newsletter and Professional and Personal Development Program for our members.</p>

                        <p class = "box-description"><b>The Funding Team focuses on the financial aspects of STEMchats to ensure that all programs and initiatives run successfully without having to endure any financial burdens</b> - much like our mission to provide equitable education at no cost!</p>
                        <p class = "box-description">The Funding team stays in constant communication with all five programs to prepare accordingly by creating budget lists, researching applicable grants, reaching out to companies/organizations for sponsorships, brainstorming alternative fundraising methods, and assisting with donations and donor relations.</p>
                        <p class = "box-description">While the main objective is to obtain money, Funding works with both the Marketing and External Development teams to build a lasting relationship with our sponsors/partners, reach and captivate new and existing audiences, <b>and ultimately, establish a financially sustainable nonprofit to accomplish our mission!</b></p>

                        <p class = "box-description"><b>The Marketing Team strives to help our audiences through education and promotion.</b> This means educating STEMchats social media audiences through a range of marketing campaigns all while promoting STEMchats programs and opportunities.</p>
                        <p class = "box-description"><b>While the primary focus is on creating graphics, videos, and general posts on social media, Marketing also helps with any other graphic design needs in order to maintain an online presence that accurately depicts the STEMchats’ brand and our values + mission.</b></p>
                        <p class = "box-description">So far, the Marketing team has (1) established a branding guide for our overall brand as well as for 4 out of 5 of our programs (2) conducted 5 general STEMchats campaigns and (3) conducted 5 program-related campaigns.</p>
