                    <p class = "box-description">The i-STEM Scholars team is excited to announce that the i-STEM Scholars Summer Research Program application (below) is currently accepting applications! The application will close at 11:49PM PST on March 26, 2021.</p>
                    <p class = "box-description">The i-STEM Scholars Research Program is a remote STEM education program for underrepresented high school students to be remotely paired with Research Mentors from all across the US. Our Research Mentors come from fields including (but not limited to) neuroscience, robotics, cell biology, computer science, physics, environmental science, and organic chemistry. For 10 weeks during the summer (June 7th - August 16th), students will learn about the basics of STEM research, delve deeper into a particular field of STEM, improve science communication skills, receive personal and college mentorship, and much more.</p>
                    <p class = "box-description">Our program is specifically designed for <b>high school students with limited background in STEM research</b>, and specifically targets students from first-generation college, low-income, traditionally underrepresented, and minoritized backgrounds. The application is open to all US-based students who will be in high school during the 2021-2022 school year. If you have questions about whether you are eligible, please check out the application for more information!</p>
                    <p class = "box-description">Students can preview the written application questions <a href="https://bit.ly/istem2021preview" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

                    <p class = "medium-box-subtitle2">We strive to accomplish our mission through a 3-pronged approach:</p>
                    <p class = "box-description">1. The annual i-STEM Scholars <b>Summer Research Program</b>, which <b>connects</b> high school students with university labs to contribute to a research project.

                    <p class = "box-description">2. Our i-STEM Scholars <b>STEM Research Toolbox</b>, which <b>educates</b> students about the <b>basic knowledge and skills in STEM research</b> through a variety of resources (such as online courses, workshops, and other interactive materials). STEM Research Toolbox materials are <b>publicly available and accessible to anyone with an internet connection.</b></p>

                    </ul>
                    <p class = "box-description">3. Upcoming <b>social media campaigns</b>, which aim to <b>inspire</b> FGLI/URM students by highlighting researchers from similar backgrounds & giving students the opportunity to interact with those in STEM research.</p>
