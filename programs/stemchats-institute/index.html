                    <p class = "box-description">STEMchats Institute is a STEM-focused workshop series designed to impact all students, especially those from disadvantaged and minority backgrounds. Our non-cumulative six-week program provides intro-level science curriculum and STEM-related career workshops at public middle schools in <b>Chicago, IL, Claremont, CA, and the Bay Area (San Francisco & Palo Alto)</b>, with help from other student & community volunteers at these sites.</p>
                    <!-- <script type="text/javascript" src="https://stemchats1.createsend.com/t/t/p/ijilhl/0/0/0/1/1/"></script> -->

                    </p>
                    <p class = "box-description">As high school and college students ourselves — where many of us are also a part of the low-income, first generation community — we understand how schools often lack the resources to properly prepare their students for future careers. As a result, the STEMchats Institute program was created to <b>make STEM education and knowledge on its career possibilities accessible</b>.</p>
                    <p class = "box-description">As STEMchats Institute continues to expand across the nation, we will be operational in as many as three US metropolitan areas by this fall. During our workshop programs, we <b>encourage students to tackle a new STEM concept every week</b>, ranging from physics to psychology, and to ultimately apply their passion and skills beyond the classroom.</p>
                    <h3 class = "medium-box-subtitle">The Difference</h3>
                    <p class = "box-description">Our mission is to stimulate the desire for more comprehensive STEM education among the middle schoolers throughout underfunded districts within the US. As a program run for students, by students, STEMchat’s Institute will be an annual, high-impact initiative that hopes to <b>shatter barriers in the STEM fields</b> through a transformative STEM education.</p>
                    <p class = "box-description">Our six week long workshop centered around a theme of “Building Blocks” aims to create collaborative workshops that expose young students to a variety of STEM fields. Workshops are taught using a <b>peer-to-peer technique at underserved schools</b> in order to demonstrate the positive and transformative applications of STEM through hands-on activities, engaged discussion, and real time feedback.</p>

                    <h3 class = "medium-box-subtitle">Work with Us</h3>
                    <p class = "box-description">We’re here to <b>empower young people and meet a community need</b>.  With STEMchats Institute, you’ll be joining a team of students from across the country who are passionate about STEM education and willing to step outside their comfort zones. Our focus on peer-to-peer workshops encourages both our team and the students we hope to impact to gain a deeper understanding of the world through a STEM perspective.</p>
                    <p class = "box-description">Joining our team will provide you with the opportunity to improve your skills in teaching and science communication—especially when <b>making complex topics engaging and accessible</b> to younger audiences—and have a positive impact on minority youth.</p>
                    <p class = "box-description">If you are interested in bringing STEMchats Institute to your school, please do not hesitate to reach out to our team at <b>stemchatsinstitute.stemchats@gmail.com</b>.
